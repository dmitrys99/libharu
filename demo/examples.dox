\example arc_demo.c
  \par Arc demo

  This demo show HPDF_Page_Arc() and HPDF_Page_Circle() functions usage.

  Pie chart is created using filled circle segments and central circle.
\example attach.c
  \par Attach demo

  This demo shows HPDF_AttachFile() function and ability to include files into resulting PDF document.
  Application expects file `pngsuite/basn3p08.png` next to binary.

  One can see attachment in Adobe Reader or in Firefox browser.
\example character_map.c
\example chfont_demo.c
\example clip_hatch.c
  \par Clipping path demo program

  This program create hatch pattern using lines, page transform (rotation) and clipping path.

  Clipping path is created using HPDF_Page_Rectangle() function. In order to make clipping work
  properly, HPDF_Page_EndPath() function \a must be called right after HPDF_Page_Clip().

\example clip_hatch2.c
  \par Clipping path demo program

  This program create hatch pattern using lines, page transform (rotation) and clipping path.

  Clipping path is created using HPDF_Page_Rectangle() function. In order to make clipping work
  properly, HPDF_Page_EndPath() function \a must be called right after HPDF_Page_Eoclip().

  In this example clipping path is complex, constructed as intersections of two rectangles.

  \par Matrix transformations combined demo program.

  This program shows usage of matrix multiplication.
  It allows to produce some delayed and combined calculations on matrices.

  Please pay attention, matrix combination operations and page operations
  are in reverse order to each other.
\example minimal.c
  \par Minimal HPDF program demo

  This is bare minimum program, creating PDF document.
  It creates \ref HPDF_Doc object, adds \ref HPDF_Page object into it,
  sets added page size and orientation and saves document to a file.

  Last action is to clean up everything.
\example outline_demo.c
\example outline_demo_jp.c
\example page_sizes_demo.c

  \par All available page sizes demo.

  This demo creates PDF file, feed it with pages of all sizes from \ref HPDF_PageSizes enumeration.
  For every page outline is created with the name of a page size from \ref HPDF_PageSizeName.
\example pattern.c
  \par PDF dictionaries, arrays and tiling patterns demo

  This demo shows usage of PDF dictionaries and arrays.
  PDF tiling pattern is created by feeding corresponding dictionaries.
  Dictionary can have stream within, in this case it is created using
  HPDF_DictStream_New() function, otherwise HPDF_Dict_New() should be called.

  Library automatically calculates cross-references when array inserted to dictionary
  or dictionary inserted to dictionary etc.

  Also, some items are inserted to page's "Resources" dictionary.
  It is done using HPDF_Page_GetInheritableItem() function.
\example pattern2.c
  \par Multiple dictionaries, arrays and matrix demo

  This demo shows usage of PDF dictionaries and arrays and matrix transformation.
  PDF tiling pattern is created by feeding corresponding dictionaries.
  Dictionary can have stream within, in this case it is created using
  HPDF_DictStream_New() function, otherwise HPDF_Dict_New() should be called.

  Library automatically calculates cross-references when array inserted to dictionary
  or dictionary inserted to dictionary etc.

  Also, some items are inserted to page's "Resources" dictionary.
  It is done using HPDF_Page_GetInheritableItem() function.

  Pattern transformation matrix is calculated using set of utility functions:
  HPDF_Matrix_Scale() and HPDF_Matrix_RotateDeg().

\example text_demo.c
  \par Text demo

  This demo app shows various ways to create text using \c libHaru:
  - Font sizes
  - Text color
  - Fill mode
  - Text rotation
  - Text skewing
  - Character spacing
  - Word spacing
\example text_demo2.c
\example transforms.c
  \par Transformation helper functions

  This program show usage of helper functions for coordinate system transformations.
  It creates transformation matrices for translate, scale, rotate and skew.
  For this purpose it uses HPDF_Page_Translate(), HPDF_Page_Scale(), HPDF_Page_Rotate()
  and HPDF_Page_Skew() respectively.

  Internally all these functions use HPDF_Page_Concat() for transformation matrix manipulation.
\example ttfont_demo.c
\example ttfont_demo_jp.c
\example utf8.c
  \par Multi-byte UTF-8 example.

  This is an UTF-8 example for multi-byte encoded text.
  It is important to have font with appropriate characters (Chinese in this example).
  <a href="https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans">Noto Sans</a> font is used here.
